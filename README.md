# sql-challenge

It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since I've have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. My first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.
In this assignment, I have designed the tables to hold data in the CSVs, imported the CSVs into a SQL database, and answered questions about the data. In other words, I have performed data engineering and data analysis.
